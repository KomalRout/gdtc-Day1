                <p class="card-body">I am a self-taught Android Developer and FrontEnd Web Developer from Bhubaneshwar,Odisha.
                    About two years ago is when I started my learning journey on how to make stunning and responsive apps and websites.
                    I have always been a curious individual, which is why I'd love to collaborate and do some real-world projects in order to flurish my skills. I'm not perfect,
                    however,I'm very far from perfection,yet I'm resilient,assertive and stubborn and I find learning a fascinating process.
                    My future plan is to learn about ML for android and web performance.

                    I am also very concerned about best practices and always sacrifice developer experience over user experience.
